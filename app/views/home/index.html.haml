      %p The concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere never exceeded 300 parts per million (ppm) in the last 800,000 years.

    %a{:href => "https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions"}
      %p Today, however, this figure is rapidly approaching 420ppm - and as it climbs further and further, global temperatures will continue to rise too.

    %a{:href => "https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/17/do-scientists-agree-on-climate-change/"}
      %p The vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is the result of human activity - and the data proves it.

    %a{:href => "https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/greenhousegases/industrialrevolution.html"}
      %p The fact that these changes in climate have only been noticeable in the last 200 years is no coincidence - they line up perfectly with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, when humans started to burn fossil fuels.

    %a{:href => "https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/climate-change/causes-of-climate-change"}
      %p Increasing the concentration of COâ‚‚ and other gases which trap heat in our atmosphere. This temperature rise will heat our oceans and melt our icecaps, causing sea levels to rise.

    %a{:href => "https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/09/13/climate-change-could-force-216-million-people-to-migrate-within-their-own-countries-by-2050"}
      %p With the combination of higher sea levels and higher temperatures, as many as 216 million people may have to leave their homes before 2050 - and this only refers to people who can migrate within the country they currently live in.
