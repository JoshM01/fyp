    %h2 And we are the reason why it is happening.

    %p The concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere never exceeded 300 parts per million (ppm) in the last 800,000 years. Today, however, this figure is rapidly approaching 420ppm - and as it climbs further and further, the higher Earth's temperature rises with it.

    %p The fact that these changes in climate have only been noticeable in the last 200 years are no coincidence. The vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is the result of human activity - primarily burning fossil fuels - increasing the concentration of COâ‚‚ and other gases which trap heat in our atmosphere.

    %p This temperature rise will heat our oceans and melt our icecaps, causing sea levels to rise. With the combination of higher sea levels and higher temperatures, hundreds of millions of people may have to leave their homes before 2050, with large-scale climate migration likely to begin by 2030.

    %p This isn't a tourism ad. All of these places are at risk of being destroyed by rising sea levels - whether through direct flooding, disruptions to water supply and/or salt water damaging buildings. The cost of inaction is extremely high.
